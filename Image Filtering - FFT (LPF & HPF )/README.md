<h1> Image Filtering by Implementing Low Pass Filter (LPF) and High Pass Filter (HPF) 
with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as visualization to gain some filterred image using gaussian blur as its methods.</h1>

Some instruction to be worked:
1. Implement image low pass filtering with FFT using CV2 and Numpy (in python notebook please) as shown in the following figures (You may use your own images).

2. Similar like task #1, but now try to implement image high pass filtering.

3. This time is somewhat difficult. You are asked to design Butterworth Notch Filter to remove repetitive noise in the input image.
