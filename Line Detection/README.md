This code aims to detect lines from the image uploaded (batch processing), using Hough Transform in OpenCV library.

I used some useful library to build this code:
* Matplotlib 
* OpenCV 
<h2>Algorithm:</h2>

1. Read the source file.
2. Grayscale with cv2.
3. Define HoughLines model.
4. Plot the model.

<h2>Result</h2>

<h2>Cant Open the File? </h2>

In case you can't open the .ipynb file and get the error message, such as:

> "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

You can open it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy-paste the link to that site.
