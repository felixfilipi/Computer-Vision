<h1>Line Detection</h1>

This code aims to detect line from the image uploaded (batch processing), using Hough Transform in OpenCV library.

I used some usefull library to build this code:
* Matplotlib (to plot image in .ipynb file)
* OpenCV (to build model)

<h2>Algorithm:</h2>

1. Read source file.
2. Grayscale with cv2.
3. Define HoughLines model.
4. Plot the model.

<h2>Result</h2>

<h2>Cant Open the File? </h2>

In case you can't see the .ipynb file, and got error

> "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

You can access it from http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy paste the link to that site.
