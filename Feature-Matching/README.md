In this section we're going to create feature matching using harris corner and feature matching. But there's a bug in the code and keep my computer crash. 
The code's not continued because time limitation, so the code implementation will not be continued.

But, the code's already fixed and can be seen in this repostiory:

You can scroll down the button and find the 4th case with harris corner implementation in it. 

## Last word

I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, there's a lack of time and information when doing the code. Thank you for your patience
